# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of hotel booking cancellations, and its objectives could be derived based on the visual insights presented in different graphs and charts. Here are the likely objectives based on the structure:

1. Monitor Hotel Booking Trends
The bar graph with monthly data (Januaryâ€“December) shows the total guests and the cancellations each month. This helps to analyze which months are seeing higher or lower cancellations.

2. Track Booking Cancellations by Guest Type
Another set of bar graphs displays the number of bookings and cancellations categorized by guest type (Couples, Family, Single). This allows an understanding of how different guest demographics contribute to booking trends and cancellations.

3. Room Status and Cancellation Rates
The "Count of room_status" vs. "Cancelled bookings" comparison provides insights into the number of "desired" (preferred) and "undesired" rooms and how cancellation rates differ between them.

4. Analyze Hotel Type Performance (City vs Resort Hotels)
The pie charts distinguish between City Hotels and Resort Hotels for total bookings and total cancellations. This breakdown shows which type of hotel (city or resort) faces more cancellations and gives insights into their overall performance.

5. Summarize Key Booking Metrics
The summary shows the total number of bookings (119,390) and total cancellations (44,224), providing a high-level view of the overall cancellation rate (around 37%).

6. Room Status and Cancellation Rates
The "Count of room_status" vs. "Cancelled bookings" comparison provides insights into the number of "desired" (preferred) and "undesired" rooms and how cancellation rates differ between them.

7. Customer Type Analysis
A dropdown on customer type (Contract, Group, Transient, Transient-Party) suggests that the dashboard can filter and analyze data based on customer types, possibly to understand specific behaviors of these groups regarding booking and cancellation.

8. Identify Seasonal Trends and Peak Periods
The monthly trends indicate peak periods for both bookings and cancellations, which can help hotels plan resources, marketing strategies, and special offers.

9. Understand the Impact of Booking Categories
The segmentation into different customer and room categories allows for more granular insight into which segments contribute most to cancellations and bookings. This can help in targeted marketing or improving service to reduce cancellations.
